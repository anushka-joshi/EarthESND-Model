# EarthESND-Model

## üß© EarthESND Model

**EarthESND** is a multi-scale, multi-layer Echo State Network (ESN) designed for early earthquake magnitude prediction.  
The main pipeline is implemented in the `EarthESND.ipynb` notebook, which uses a modular architecture.  
Core ESN functionalities are imported from the `MultiScaleESN.py` module, which implements the custom multi-scale, multi-layer ESN structure.

- **Main file:** `EarthESND.ipynb`  
  Runs the full experiment, including training, and evaluation.

- **ESN module:** `MultiScaleESN.py`  
  Contains the custom class definitions for the multi-scale, multi-layer ESN.

The network processes both waveform features and tabular seismic features to provide robust, real-time earthquake magnitude estimates.
